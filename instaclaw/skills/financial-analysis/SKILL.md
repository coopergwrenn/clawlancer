## Analysis Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

1. **Never give financial advice.** Say "The data shows..." not "You should buy/sell..."
2. **Always include disclaimer.** Every analysis ends with: "This is data analysis, not financial advice. All trading decisions are yours."
3. **Use indicator confluence.** Need 3+ indicators agreeing before calling a trend.
4. **State confidence levels.** "4/5 indicators bullish" vs "Mixed: 2 bullish, 2 bearish, 1 neutral"
5. **Mention what could go wrong.** Every bullish call includes the bear case, and vice versa.
6. **Context matters.** Pre-earnings/Fed = lower confidence on technicals.
7. **Timeframe clarity.** "On the daily chart..." vs "On the 15-minute..."
8. **Options carry extra risk.** Always note weeklies can expire worthless, theta decay accelerates.

## Workflow 1: Stock Technical Analysis

When user says: "Give me SPX technical analysis" or "How's SPY looking?"

```
STEP 1: Pull current data
├── GET daily prices — last 100 days
├── GET intraday prices (15min) — today's session
└── GET current quote — latest price + volume + change

STEP 2: Compute key indicators
├── RSI (14-period) — overbought >70 / oversold <30
├── MACD (12,26,9) — trend direction + crossover signals
├── Bollinger Bands (20,2) — volatility squeeze / expansion
├── SMA 50 + SMA 200 — golden cross / death cross
├── ADX (14) — trend strength (>25 trending, <20 ranging)
├── Stochastic (14,3,3) — momentum confirmation
└── Volume — compare to 20-day average (conviction check)

STEP 3: Identify key levels
├── Support: Recent swing lows, SMA 50, lower Bollinger
├── Resistance: Recent swing highs, SMA 200, upper Bollinger
└── Options-relevant strikes: Round numbers near current price

STEP 4: Generate analysis
├── Trend assessment (bullish/bearish/neutral with confidence)
├── Key levels to watch
├── Indicator confluence (how many agree?)
├── Risk factors (earnings, Fed, economic data)
└── DISCLAIMER: Not financial advice

STEP 5: Deliver via Telegram/Discord
```

```

## Workflow 2: Crypto Technical Analysis

When user says: "BTC analysis" or "How's ETH looking?"

Same indicator stack as stocks, but:
- Crypto trades 24/7 (daily = midnight UTC close)
- More volatile — widen Bollinger Band interpretation
- Add crypto-specific context: BTC dominance, macro correlation (DXY, rates)
- Use Alpha Vantage news sentiment for crypto-specific news
- Use Brave Search for on-chain metrics when available

## Workflow 3: Options Chain Analysis

When user says: "Show me SPY options" or "Weekly calls?"

```
STEP 1: Pull options chain
├── GET options chain with Greeks
├── Filter by expiry (default: nearest weekly/monthly)
└── Include IV, delta, gamma, theta, vega

STEP 2: Analyze
├── Open interest distribution (where's the crowd?)
├── Put/call ratio
├── IV rank vs historical
├── Max pain calculation
├── Unusual activity detection (OI spikes)

STEP 3: Present with risk context
├── Greeks explained in plain English
├── Theta decay warning for weeklies
├── IV percentile context
└── DISCLAIMER: Options can expire worthless
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-interpreting single indicators** — Need confluence, not just "RSI is 65"
2. **Ignoring macro context** — Day before Fed decision overrides technicals
3. **Presenting analysis as advice** — "Data shows X" never "You should do Y"
4. **No timeframe specified** — Always state daily vs intraday vs weekly
5. **Stale data without acknowledgment** — Always show timestamp, note if market is open/closed
6. **Hammering the API** — Cache responses, check rate-status before bulk requests
