# Common Mistakes: English Speakers Learning Portuguese (Brazilian)

This reference covers the most frequent and persistent errors English speakers make
when learning Brazilian Portuguese. Use it to anticipate mistakes, correct them
gently, and explain the "why" behind the right answer.

Focus: **Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)**. European Portuguese differences are noted
where critical, but this guide assumes the learner is targeting Brazilian usage.

## 1. False Cognates (Falsos Amigos)

These are the words that betray you. They look like English words but mean something
entirely different. English speakers reach for them instinctively and get burned.

| Portuguese Word | What English Speakers Assume | Actual Meaning | Correct PT Word for the English Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **puxar** | push | to pull | empurrar |
| **pretender** | to pretend | to intend, to plan | fingir |
| **exquisito** | exquisite | strange, weird, picky | refinado, primoroso |
| **parentes** | parents | relatives | pais |
| **pasta** | pasta (food) | folder, briefcase, paste | macarrão, massa |
| **assistir** | to assist | to watch, to attend | ajudar |
| **costume** | costume (outfit) | custom, habit | fantasia |
| **educated** / **educado** | educated (schooled) | polite, well-mannered | instruído, culto |
| **resumo** | resume (CV) | summary | currículo |
| **preservativo** | preservative (food) | condom | conservante |
| **propaganda** | propaganda (political) | advertisement, commercial | propaganda (same word, but broader meaning) |
| **pais** | pays (to pay) | parents; or country (país) | pagar (verb) |
| **livraria** | library | bookstore | biblioteca |
| **notícia** | notice (warning) | news item | aviso |
| **sensível** | sensible | sensitive | sensato |
| **compromisso** | compromise | commitment, appointment | acordo, meio-termo |
| **actually** / **atualmente** | actually | currently, nowadays | na verdade, de fato |
| **fabric** / **fábrica** | fabric (cloth) | factory | tecido |
| **lecture** / **leitura** | lecture | reading (the act of reading) | palestra, aula |

### Key Correction Pattern

When a learner says *"Eu vou puxar a porta"* meaning "I'll push the door":

> Almost! Puxar actually means to pull — it's a classic false friend. To push = **empurrar**.
> "Eu vou empurrar a porta."

## 2. Grammar Patterns That Go Wrong

### 2.1 Ser vs Estar — The Double "To Be"

English has one verb for "to be." Portuguese has two, and mixing them up changes
meaning or sounds completely wrong.

| Use **SER** for | Use **ESTAR** for |
|---|---|
| Identity: *Eu sou brasileiro.* | Temporary states: *Eu estou cansado.* |
| Profession: *Ela e professora.* | Emotions (current): *Ele esta feliz.* |
| Origin: *Nos somos de Sao Paulo.* | Location of people/things: *O livro esta na mesa.* |
| Inherent qualities: *O gelo e frio.* | Health: *Eu estou doente.* |
| Time/date: *Sao tres horas.* | Weather (current): *Esta quente hoje.* |
| Material: *A mesa e de madeira.* | Ongoing actions (with gerund): *Estou trabalhando.* |

**The meaning-changing pairs:**

- *Ele e chato.* = He IS boring (personality trait).
- *Ele esta chato.* = He is BEING annoying (right now).
- *Ela e bonita.* = She is beautiful (always).
- *Ela esta bonita.* = She looks beautiful (today, in that outfit).
- *O cafe e quente.* = Coffee is hot (by nature).
- *O cafe esta quente.* = This coffee is hot (right now, careful).

### 2.2 Gendered Nouns — Everything Has a Gender

English speakers forget to assign gender. Portuguese has no neutral — every noun is
masculine (o) or feminine (a).

**Reliable patterns:**

| Ending | Gender | Examples | Exceptions |
|---|---|---|---|
| -o | Masculine | o livro, o carro, o gato | a mao (hand), a foto, a moto |
| -a | Feminine | a casa, a mesa, a porta | o dia (day), o mapa, o problema, o sistema |
| -ade | Feminine | a cidade, a verdade, a liberdade | (none common) |
| -cao | Feminine | a nacao, a situacao, a educacao | o coracao (heart) |
| -agem | Feminine | a viagem, a personagem, a paisagem | (none common) |
| -mente | Feminine | (adverbs, not nouns) | N/A |

**The "-ma" trap:** Words ending in -ma borrowed from Greek are masculine:
o problema, o sistema, o tema, o cinema, o drama, o programa.

English speakers constantly say *"a problema"* — it's always *"o problema."*

### 2.3 Verb Conjugation — Six Persons, Not Two

English essentially conjugates for two forms (I run / he runs). Portuguese
conjugates for six. Every. Single. Tense.

**Present tense of FALAR (to speak) — regular -ar verb:**

| Person | Conjugation |
|---|---|
| eu | fal**o** |
| voce / ele / ela | fal**a** |
| nos | fal**amos** |
| voces / eles / elas | fal**am** |

**Note:** In Brazilian Portuguese, "tu" (you informal) is used regionally (Rio Grande
do Sul, parts of the North). Most of Brazil uses "voce" with third-person conjugation.

**The 5 irregular verbs that will haunt you:**

| Verb | eu | voce | nos | voces |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ser (to be) | sou | e | somos | sao |
| ir (to go) | vou | vai | vamos | vao |
| ter (to have) | tenho | tem | temos | tem |
| fazer (to do/make) | faco | faz | fazemos | fazem |
| poder (to be able) | posso | pode | podemos | podem |

### 2.4 Preposition Differences

English prepositions do NOT translate directly. These are the most common traps.

| English | Wrong Instinct | Correct Portuguese |
|---|---|---|
| to think **about** | pensar **sobre** | pensar **em** |
| to depend **on** | depender **em** | depender **de** |
| to marry (someone) | casar **com alguem** is actually correct | casar **com** |
| to dream **about** | sonhar **sobre** | sonhar **com** |
| to arrive **at/in** | chegar **em** (common but informal) | chegar **a** (formal/correct) |
| to pay **for** | pagar **por** (sometimes correct) | pagar -- (direct object, no preposition) |
| to look **at** | olhar **a** | olhar **para** |
| to play (instrument) | jogar | tocar (instruments); jogar (sports/games) |

### 2.5 The Subjunctive — Portuguese Actually Uses It

English speakers barely use the subjunctive ("If I were..." and that's about it).
Portuguese uses it constantly, and skipping it sounds uneducated.

**When you MUST use subjunctive in Portuguese:**

| Trigger | Example |
|---|---|
| Doubt/wish (querer que, esperar que) | *Eu quero que voce **fale** portugues.* |
| Uncertainty (talvez) | *Talvez ele **venha** amanha.* |
| Hypothetical (se + imperfect subj.) | *Se eu **fosse** rico, viajaria.* |
| Emotion (e bom que, e triste que) | *E bom que voce **esteja** aqui.* |
| Negation of certainty (nao acho que) | *Nao acho que ele **saiba**.* |
| Future uncertainty (quando + future) | *Quando voce **chegar**, me liga.* |

**Common mistake:** *"Eu quero que voce fala"* (indicative) instead of
*"Eu quero que voce fale"* (subjunctive). The "que" after a wish/desire verb is
a subjunctive trigger every single time.

### 2.6 Personal Infinitive — Unique to Portuguese

This does not exist in English, Spanish, French, or most other languages. It's an
infinitive that conjugates for person. English speakers don't even know to look for it.

| Standard Infinitive | Personal Infinitive |
|---|---|
| E importante falar. | E importante falar**mos**. (for us to speak) |
| Antes de sair... | Antes de eles sair**em**... (before they leave) |

**When to use it:** When the subject of the infinitive clause is different from the
subject of the main clause, or when you want to clarify who is doing the action.

- *E dificil para nos entender**mos** isso.* (It's hard for us to understand this.)
- *Apesar de eles ter**em** dinheiro...* (Despite them having money...)

### 2.7 Clitics and Pronoun Placement

Where to put "me", "te", "se", "nos" etc. drives English speakers crazy.

**Brazilian Portuguese spoken rule (simplified):**
Put the pronoun BEFORE the verb in most cases.

- *Me da um cafe.* (Give me a coffee.) -- spoken BR standard
- *Eu te amo.* (I love you.)
- *Ele se sentou.* (He sat down.)

**Formal/written rule:** Pronoun goes AFTER the verb with a hyphen, unless there's
a "trigger word" (nao, que, ja, sempre, etc.) that pulls it before.

- *Da-me um cafe.* (formal/written/European)
- *Nao me da um cafe.* ("nao" pulls the pronoun forward)

**In practice for Brazilian learners:** Proclisis (before the verb) is almost always
acceptable in speech. Don't stress about this early on.

### 2.8 Definite Articles with Names

In Brazilian Portuguese, people use "o" and "a" before first names. This sounds
bizarre to English speakers but is completely normal and even expected.

- *A Maria ligou pra voce.* (Maria called you.)
- *O Joao esta atrasado.* (Joao is late.)
- *Voce conhece a Fernanda?* (Do you know Fernanda?)

**When NOT to use the article:** With famous people or formal contexts where you use
the full name. Regional variation exists — Sao Paulo uses articles with names more
than some other regions.

### 2.9 Diminutives — Not Just About Size

English speakers think -inho/-inha means "small." It does, but it also means
affection, politeness, softening, and sometimes even sarcasm.

| Usage | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Actual small size | *casinha* | little house |
| Affection | *amorzinho* | sweetheart, darling |
| Softening a request | *Um momentinho* | Just a moment (polite) |
| Making things cozy | *cervejinha* | a nice cold beer (not small) |
| Downplaying | *E pertinho* | It's nearby (may not be that close) |
| Sarcasm (with tone) | *Bonitinho* | "Cute" (dismissive) |

**Formation rules:**
- Words ending in vowel: drop vowel, add -inho/a (*casa -> casinha*)
- Words ending in consonant or stressed vowel: add -zinho/a (*cafe -> cafezinho*)
- Words ending in -ao: *-aozinho* or *-aozinha* (*mao -> maozinha*)

### 2.10 Ficar — The Verb That Does Everything

English speakers try to translate "ficar" as one thing. It's at least six.

| Meaning | Example | English |
|---|---|---|
| To stay | *Fica aqui.* | Stay here. |
| To become | *Ele ficou triste.* | He became sad. |
| To be located | *A padaria fica na esquina.* | The bakery is on the corner. |
| To keep/remain | *Fica quieto.* | Stay quiet. / Be quiet. |
| To turn out | *O bolo ficou otimo.* | The cake turned out great. |
| To hook up with (informal) | *Eles ficaram na festa.* | They hooked up at the party. |

**Common mistake:** Using "tornar-se" or "virar" when "ficar" is more natural for
emotional/state changes. *"Eu tornei-me feliz"* sounds stiff; *"Eu fiquei feliz"*
is what people actually say.

## 3. Pronunciation Traps

### 3.1 Nasal Vowels

English has NO nasal vowels. Portuguese has five. These are non-negotiable for being
understood.

| Nasal Vowel | Example | English Speaker Tendency | How to Produce It |
|---|---|---|---|
| a (~) | *maca, irma* | Says flat "ah" | Say "ah" but push air through nose |
| ao (~) | *nao, pao, cao* | Says "now" | Nasalized "ow" — lips round, air through nose |
| oe (~) | *coracoes, limoes* | Says "oy" | Nasalized "oy-sh" |
| e (~) | *bem, tem, tambem* | Says "en" or "em" | Nasalized "ay" — no "n" sound at end |
| i (~) (rare) | *sim, fim* | Says "een" | Nasalized "ee" |

**The test:** Hold your nose. If the sound changes, you're nasalizing correctly.
If it sounds the same, you're not nasalizing at all.

### 3.2 The "nh" Sound (/ɲ/)

Like Spanish n with tilde. English doesn't have this as a single sound.

- *banho* (bath) = "BAH-nyoo" not "BAN-ho"
- *minha* (my) = "MEE-nya" not "MIN-ha"
- *caminho* (path) = "ka-MEE-nyoo"

### 3.3 The "lh" Sound (/ʎ/)

Like Italian "gli" or Spanish "ll" (in some dialects). NOT an English "l."

- *trabalho* (work) = "tra-BAH-lyoo" not "tra-BAL-ho"
- *filho* (son) = "FEE-lyoo"
- *olho* (eye) = "OH-lyoo"

### 3.4 The R Problem — Two Completely Different Sounds

| Position | Sound | Example | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Word-initial | /h/ (like English H) | *rio, roupa* | "HEE-oo", "HOH-pa" |
| Double rr | /h/ | *carro, terra* | "KAH-hoo", "TEH-ha" |
| Between vowels (single r) | /ɾ/ (flap, like Spanish) | *caro, para* | "KAH-roo", "PAH-ra" |
| End of syllable | /h/ or silent (varies by region) | *porta, falar* | "POH-ta" or "POH-ha" |

**The critical pair:** *caro* (expensive, flapped r) vs *carro* (car, H sound).
English speakers say both the same way. Brazilians hear two totally different words.

### 3.5 Open vs Closed Vowels — Meaning Changes

| Word | Vowel | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| av**o** (closed, o) | /o/ | grandfather |
| av**o** (open, o) | /ɔ/ | grandmother |
| **e**le (closed) | /e/ | he (pronoun) |
| **e** (open) | /ɛ/ | is (verb ser) |
| s**e**co (closed e, open o) | | dry (adjective) |

Accent marks help: **o** (circumflex) = closed, **o** (acute) = open. Same for **e** / **e**.

### 3.6 D and T Palatalization (Brazilian Portuguese)

Before "i" and "e" (in many regions, especially Rio, Sao Paulo, and most of Brazil):

| Letter | Before i/e | Sounds Like | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| d | di, de | "dj" (/dʒ/) | *dia* = "DJEE-a", *de* = "djee" |
| t | ti, te | "ch" (/tʃ/) | *tia* = "CHEE-a", *noite* = "NOY-chee" |

**English speakers** say "dee-a" and "tee-a" with hard d/t sounds. This immediately
marks you as a foreigner. The palatalized versions are essential for natural-sounding
Brazilian Portuguese.

### 3.7 Stress and Accent Marks

Portuguese has predictable stress rules, and accent marks exist specifically to show
exceptions. English speakers ignore them.

**Default stress rules:**
- Words ending in **a, e, o, am, em** -> stress on second-to-last syllable
- Words ending in **i, u, consonants (except m/s)** -> stress on last syllable
- **Accent marks override** these defaults

**Meaning-changing accents:**

| Without Accent | With Accent | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| *esta* (this, fem.) | *esta* (is — verb estar) | demonstrative vs verb |
| *pode* (can — present) | *pode* (could — past, pode) | present vs past |
| *e* (and) | *e* (is — verb ser) | conjunction vs verb |
| *por* (by, through) | *por* (to put — verb por) | preposition vs verb |
| *sede* (headquarters) | *sede* (thirst) | different meaning entirely |

### 3.8 The Letter X — Four or More Sounds

The letter "x" in Portuguese is chaotic:

| Sound | Example | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|
| /ʃ/ ("sh") | *xicara, caixa, baixo* | "SHEE-ka-ra", "KAI-sha" |
| /ks/ | *taxi, fixo, toxico* | "TAK-see", "FEE-ksoo" |
| /z/ | *exame, exemplo, exercicio* | "eh-ZAH-mee" |
| /s/ | *proximo, auxiliar, experiencia* | "PROH-see-moo" |

There is no reliable rule. You memorize each word. Sorry.

### 3.9 Word-Final Vowel Reduction

Unstressed final vowels in Brazilian Portuguese shift:
- Final **e** often sounds like "ee" -> *grande* = "GRAHN-djee"
- Final **o** often sounds like "oo" -> *livro* = "LEE-vroo"

English speakers pronounce them as full vowels, which sounds overly enunciated.

### 3.10 The "L" at End of Syllables

In Brazilian Portuguese, "l" at the end of a syllable becomes a "w" sound:

- *Brasil* = "bra-ZEW" (not "bra-ZEEL")
- *sal* = "saw" (not "sal")
- *hospital* = "os-pee-TAW"
- *legal* = "leh-GAW"

This catches every English speaker off guard.

## 4. Cultural Communication Tips

### 4.1 Greetings — Physical and Verbal

**Beijinho (little kiss):** Brazilians greet with a kiss on the cheek (one in Sao
Paulo, two in Rio, varies by region). Not doing it when expected is awkward. Doing
it when not expected is also awkward. Follow the other person's lead.

**"Tudo bem?"** is a greeting, not a genuine question. The expected answer is
*"Tudo bem!"* or *"Tudo bom!"* — not a detailed status report. Equivalent to
English "How are you?" / "Fine."

**"E ai?"** — Very informal greeting among friends. Like "What's up?" Answer:
*"E ai, beleza?"* or *"De boa."*

### 4.2 Voce vs O Senhor / A Senhora

| Register | When to Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Voce** | Peers, younger people, informal settings | Default in most of Brazil |
| **Tu** | Regional (RS, parts of North/Northeast) | Often with voce-conjugation informally |
| **O senhor / A senhora** | Elderly, authority figures, formal service | Shows respect; not using it can offend |

**Mistake:** English speakers use "voce" with everyone because English only has "you."
Using "voce" with an elderly person you just met can come across as disrespectful.

### 4.3 Jeitinho Brasileiro

The "Brazilian way" — a cultural tendency to find creative, informal solutions to
bureaucratic or rigid problems. Not exactly rule-breaking, more like... flexible
problem-solving. Understanding this concept helps you understand a LOT of Brazilian
social interactions and why things work the way they do.

Useful phrase: *"Da um jeitinho"* = Figure out a way / make it work.

### 4.4 Time Flexibility

If a Brazilian says a party starts at 8pm, showing up at 8pm means you will be alone
with the host who is still getting ready. Social events operate on a sliding scale:

- Dinner party at 8 -> arrive 8:30-9:00
- Bar meetup at 7 -> arrive 7:30-8:00
- Business meeting at 10 -> arrive at 10 (business is more punctual)

### 4.5 Physical Warmth in Communication

Brazilians stand closer, touch more during conversation (arm touches, shoulder pats),
and hug more than Anglophone cultures. This is normal and expected. Pulling away or
maintaining a "cold" distance can be perceived as unfriendly.

### 4.6 Diminutives Convey Warmth

Using diminutives is not childish — it's warm and friendly:

- *"Vamos tomar uma cervejinha?"* — Let's grab a beer? (sounds inviting)
- *"So um minutinho."* — Just a minute. (sounds patient/polite)
- *"Obrigadinho/a."* — Thanks! (casual, warm)
- *"Oi, benzinho."* — Hi, sweetheart. (affectionate)

NOT using diminutives in casual contexts can make you sound cold or overly formal.

### 4.7 "No" Is Softened

Brazilians rarely give a hard "no." They soften refusals:

- Instead of *"Nao"* -> *"Acho que nao vai dar"* (I think it won't work out)
- Instead of *"Nao quero"* -> *"Agora nao, talvez depois"* (Not now, maybe later)
- *"Vou tentar"* (I'll try) often means "probably not"

Understanding this indirectness prevents miscommunication.

## 5. Common Sentence Structure Errors

These are real mistakes English speakers make, with corrections and explanations.

### Word Order and Adjective Placement

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *Uma grande casa* | **Uma casa grande** | Adjectives usually follow the noun in Portuguese. Some adjectives (bom, grande, mau) CAN precede for emphasis, but default is after. |
| 2 | *O vermelho carro* | **O carro vermelho** | Color adjectives always follow the noun. |
| 3 | *Meu melhor amigo velho* | **Meu melhor amigo** / **Meu velho amigo** | "Melhor" (best) precedes; "velho" before noun = long-time, after noun = old in age. |

### Ser vs Estar Confusion

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | *Eu sou cansado.* | **Eu estou cansado.** | Tiredness is a temporary state -> estar. Using "sou" implies you are a permanently tired person. |
| 5 | *A comida e quente.* | **A comida esta quente.** | The food is hot right now -> estar. (Unless you mean "food is hot by nature.") |
| 6 | *Ele esta brasileiro.* | **Ele e brasileiro.** | Nationality is permanent identity -> ser. |

### Verb Conjugation Errors

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | *Eu e minha amiga vai ao cinema.* | **Eu e minha amiga vamos ao cinema.** | "Eu e minha amiga" = nos -> vamos. English speakers forget that compound subjects including "eu" require first person plural. |
| 8 | *Nos foi ao parque.* | **Nos fomos ao parque.** | "Nos" requires first person plural conjugation (fomos), not third person singular (foi). |
| 9 | *Ela tem 25 anos velho.* | **Ela tem 25 anos.** | Portuguese uses "ter X anos" (to have X years). No "old" needed. Direct English calque. |

### Preposition Mistakes

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | *Eu penso sobre voce.* | **Eu penso em voce.** | "Pensar" takes "em", not "sobre." |
| 11 | *Eu estou procurando por meu celular.* | **Eu estou procurando meu celular.** | "Procurar" is a direct verb — no preposition needed. English "look for" misleads. |
| 12 | *Ela pagou por o jantar.* | **Ela pagou o jantar.** | "Pagar" takes a direct object for the thing paid for. |
| 13 | *Eu sonhei sobre voce.* | **Eu sonhei com voce.** | "Sonhar" takes "com", not "sobre." |

### Subjunctive Avoidance

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | *Eu quero que voce fala portugues.* | **Eu quero que voce fale portugues.** | "Querer que" triggers subjunctive. Always. |
| 15 | *Quando voce chega, me avisa.* | **Quando voce chegar, me avisa.** | Future "quando" requires future subjunctive (chegar). |
| 16 | *Se eu era rico...* | **Se eu fosse rico...** | Hypothetical "se" requires imperfect subjunctive (fosse). |
| 17 | *Talvez ele vem amanha.* | **Talvez ele venha amanha.** | "Talvez" triggers subjunctive. |

### Article and Gender Errors

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | *A problema e serio.* | **O problema e serio.** | "Problema" is masculine despite ending in -a (Greek origin). Also: o sistema, o tema, o cinema. |
| 19 | *Eu sou um estudante.* (said by a woman) | **Eu sou uma estudante.** | Articles and some nouns must agree with the speaker's gender. |
| 20 | *Gosto de a musica.* | **Gosto da musica.** | Preposition "de" + article "a" contracts to "da." Contractions are mandatory, not optional. |

### Direct Translation Calques

| # | Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | *Eu estou quente.* (meaning "I'm hot/warm") | **Eu estou com calor.** | "Eu estou quente" means "I'm sexually aroused." Temperature = "estar com calor/frio." |
| 22 | *Fazer sentido* is correct, but *Fazer uma decisao* | **Tomar uma decisao** | Decisions are "taken" (tomar) in Portuguese, not "made." |
| 23 | *Eu sou excitado para a festa.* | **Eu estou animado para a festa.** | "Excitado" means sexually aroused. Excited = "animado" or "empolgado." |
| 24 | *Eu tenho um bom tempo.* | **Eu me diverti.** / **Foi muito legal.** | "Have a good time" does not translate literally. Use "divertir-se" or describe it differently. |
| 25 | *Isso faz-me sentir bem.* | **Isso me faz sentir bem.** | In Brazilian Portuguese, the pronoun "me" goes before the verb in most spoken contexts. |

## Quick Reference: The Top 10 Mistakes to Catch First

These are the errors you will see most often from English-speaking beginners. Correct
these gently and repeatedly:

1. **Ser vs Estar confusion** — especially with emotions and temporary states
2. **"Eu estou excitado/quente"** — embarrassing false cognates
3. **Adjective before noun** — English word order bleeding through
4. **Missing subjunctive** after "quero que", "talvez", "quando" (future)
5. **"Ter X anos"** — adding "velho" after age
6. **Prepositions** — "pensar sobre" instead of "pensar em"
7. **Gender of -ma words** — "a problema" instead of "o problema"
8. **No contraction** — "de o" instead of "do", "em a" instead of "na"
9. **Hard d/t sounds** before i — not palatalizing "dia" and "tia"
10. **Pronouncing R as English R** — it's /h/ at the start and double, /ɾ/ between vowels
