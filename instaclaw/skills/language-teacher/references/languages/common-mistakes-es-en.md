## 1. False Cognates (Falsos Amigos)

Spanish and English share thousands of Latin-root cognates, but dozens of them
have diverged in meaning. These "false friends" cause the most embarrassing
(not *embarazoso*) mistakes.

| # | Spanish Word | English Look-Alike | Spanish Actually Means | English Word Actually Means | Correct English Equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | embarazada | embarrassed | pregnant | feeling ashamed/awkward | pregnant |
| 2 | actualmente | actually | currently, at present | in fact, really | currently / nowadays |
| 3 | sensible | sensible | sensitive, emotional | practical, reasonable | sensitive |
| 4 | éxito | exit | success | a way out / door | success |
| 5 | fábrica | fabric | factory | cloth, textile material | factory |
| 6 | carpeta | carpet | folder, binder | floor covering / rug | folder |
| 7 | conductor | conductor | driver (of a vehicle) | orchestra leader / train official | driver |
| 8 | constipado | constipated | having a cold | unable to pass stool | having a cold |
| 9 | librería | library | bookstore | public lending collection | bookstore |
| 10 | realizar | realize | to carry out, accomplish | to become aware of | to carry out / accomplish |
| 11 | asistir | assist | to attend (an event) | to help | to attend |
| 12 | recordar | record | to remember | to capture audio/video | to remember |
| 13 | pretender | pretend | to attempt, to court | to fake, to feign | to try / to court |
| 14 | soportar | support | to tolerate, endure | to hold up, back, fund | to tolerate / to bear |
| 15 | introducir | introduce | to insert, to input | to present someone | to insert / to input |
| 16 | largo | large | long | big in size | long |
| 17 | delito | delight | crime, offence | great pleasure | crime / offence |
| 18 | disgusto | disgust | upset, annoyance | revulsion, strong dislike | annoyance / upset |
| 19 | molestar | molest | to bother, to annoy | to sexually abuse | to bother / to annoy |
| 20 | contestar | contest | to answer, to reply | to challenge, to compete | to answer / to reply |
| 21 | compromiso | compromise | commitment, obligation | mutual concession | commitment / agreement |
| 22 | suburbio | suburb | slum, shantytown | residential area outside city | slum |
| 23 | lectura | lecture | reading (act of reading) | formal talk / scolding | reading |
| 24 | bizarro | bizarre | brave, generous (literary) | strange, weird | brave / gallant |
| 25 | aviso | advice | warning, notice | guidance, recommendation | warning / notice |

### Usage Examples

- **embarazada**: "She's not embarrassed -- she's *pregnant*." (Ella no esta avergonzada -- esta embarazada.)
- **actualmente**: "Actually, I disagree" does NOT mean "Actualmente, no estoy de acuerdo." Use "currently" for *actualmente* and "in fact / actually" for *en realidad*.
- **sensible**: "He's a sensible person" = Es una persona razonable. "He's a sensitive person" = Es una persona sensible.
- **largo**: "A large pizza" = Una pizza grande. "A long road" = Un camino largo.
- **soportar**: "I can't support him" (financially) vs. "I can't stand him" (tolerate) -- *No lo soporto* = I can't stand him.

## 2. Grammar Patterns That Transfer Wrong

### 2.1 Ser / Estar Collapse into "To Be"

Spanish distinguishes permanent qualities (ser) from temporary states (estar).
English uses "to be" for both, but the mental model carries over and causes errors.

| Spanish | Incorrect English | Correct English | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soy aburrido | I am bored (when meaning boring) | I am boring / I am bored | ser aburrido = boring; estar aburrido = bored |
| Estoy listo | I am ready → I am clever | I am ready | ser listo = clever; estar listo = ready |
| Es muy alto | He is very tall | He is very tall | (This one transfers fine) |
| Estoy siendo bueno | I am being good | I am being good | (This one also transfers) |

The main danger: adjectives that change meaning with ser/estar in Spanish sometimes cause learners to overthink English "to be."

### 2.2 Adjective Placement

Spanish: noun + adjective. English: adjective + noun.

| Incorrect | Correct |
|---|---|
| The house white | The white house |
| A car red and fast | A fast red car |
| The man tall | The tall man |
| Shoes comfortable | Comfortable shoes |

Note: English adjective order follows a fixed sequence (opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin-material-purpose). Spanish speakers may also scramble this order.

### 2.3 Double Negatives

Spanish requires double (or multiple) negation. English forbids it in standard usage.

| Spanish (correct) | English (incorrect) | English (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| No quiero nada | I don't want nothing | I don't want anything |
| No vi a nadie | I didn't see nobody | I didn't see anybody |
| Nunca dije nada | I never said nothing | I never said anything |
| No hay ninguno | There isn't none | There isn't any / There are none |

### 2.4 Missing Subject Pronouns

Spanish is a pro-drop language (subject pronouns are optional). English requires them.

| Spanish | Incorrect English | Correct English |
|---|---|---|
| Llueve | Is raining | It is raining |
| Es importante | Is important that... | It is important that... |
| Parece que si | Seems like it | It seems like it |
| Hay muchos | Are many | There are many |
| Hace frio | Is cold | It is cold |

### 2.5 Do-Support Absence

Spanish forms questions and negations without an auxiliary "do." English requires it.

| Spanish Pattern | Incorrect English | Correct English |
|---|---|---|
| Te gusta la pizza? | You like pizza? | Do you like pizza? |
| No entiendo | I no understand | I don't understand |
| Donde vives? | Where you live? | Where do you live? |
| No fue ayer | He no went yesterday | He didn't go yesterday |

### 2.6 Preposition Mismatches

Direct translation of Spanish prepositions produces wrong collocations.

| Spanish | Literal Translation | Correct English |
|---|---|---|
| sonar con | dream with | dream about / dream of |
| depender de | depend of | depend on |
| pensar en | think in | think about |
| casarse con | marry with | marry (no preposition) |
| enamorarse de | fall in love of | fall in love with |
| esperar a | wait to | wait for |
| consistir en | consist in | consist of |
| entrar en | enter in | enter (no preposition) |
| jugar a | play to | play (no preposition for sports) |

### 2.7 Present Perfect vs Simple Past

Spanish *preterito perfecto* (he comido) overlaps with English present perfect (I have eaten), but usage contexts differ significantly. In many Latin American varieties, simple past dominates, causing further confusion.

| Situation | Spanish Speaker Says | Correct English |
|---|---|---|
| Something that just happened | I have eaten lunch 5 minutes ago | I ate lunch 5 minutes ago |
| A finished past event | I have visited Paris in 2019 | I visited Paris in 2019 |
| Life experience (correct!) | I have visited Paris three times | I have visited Paris three times |
| Unfinished time period (correct!) | I have worked here since May | I have worked here since May |

**Rule of thumb**: If there is a finished time marker (yesterday, in 2019, last week, ago), use simple past. If the time frame is unfinished or unspecified, present perfect is possible.

### 2.8 Gender Agreement Attempts on English Nouns

Spanish nouns have grammatical gender. Learners sometimes transfer this mental model.

| Error Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Gendering pronouns for objects | "Where is the table? She is in the kitchen." |
| Adding gender suffixes | "My friend is a doctora" (mixing languages) |
| Choosing he/she for animals | "The cat, she is sleeping" (when gender is unknown) |

English uses "it" for objects and animals of unknown sex. Reserve he/she for people and named/known-sex animals.

### 2.9 Reflexive Verb Confusion

Spanish reflexive verbs are far more common. Learners over-apply reflexive patterns.

| Incorrect | Correct | Spanish Source |
|---|---|---|
| I washed me | I washed myself | Me lave |
| She dressed her | She got dressed | Se vistio |
| We sat us down | We sat down | Nos sentamos |
| I feel me tired | I feel tired | Me siento cansado |

### 2.10 Article Overuse and Misuse

Spanish uses articles more broadly. English omits them in many contexts.

| Incorrect | Correct | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The life is beautiful | Life is beautiful | No article for abstract/general nouns |
| I like the music | I like music | General preference, no article |
| The people are nice in the Spain | People are nice in Spain | No article for countries (most) or general "people" |
| I go to the school every day | I go to school every day | "Go to school" = attend as student (idiomatic) |
| She plays the tennis | She plays tennis | No article for sports |

### 2.11 Make vs Do (Hacer = Both)

Spanish uses *hacer* for both "make" and "do," leading to frequent confusion.

| Incorrect | Correct | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| I need to make my homework | I need to do my homework | "do" for tasks, duties, activities |
| She does cakes for a living | She makes cakes for a living | "make" for creating/producing |
| Can you make me a favour? | Can you do me a favour? | "do" a favour |
| I did a mistake | I made a mistake | "make" a mistake (fixed collocation) |
| He makes exercise every day | He does exercise every day | "do" exercise |

**Quick guide**: "make" = create/produce something; "do" = perform an activity/task. But many are fixed collocations that must be memorized.

### 2.12 "People Is" Instead of "People Are"

*Gente* in Spanish is singular. *People* in English is plural.

| Incorrect | Correct |
|---|---|
| People is very kind here | People are very kind here |
| The police is coming | The police are coming |
| My family is coming (debatable) | My family are coming (BrE) / My family is coming (AmE) |

## 3. Pronunciation Traps

### 3.1 /b/ vs /v/ Merger

In most Spanish dialects, "b" and "v" are allophones of the same phoneme. English treats them as distinct.

| English Word | Spanish Tendency | Correct Sound |
|---|---|---|
| very | berry | /v/ -- lower lip touches upper teeth |
| vest | best | /v/ not /b/ |
| vote | boat | /v/ not /b/ |
| van | ban | /v/ not /b/ |

**Practice**: Feel the vibration on your lower lip for /v/. For /b/, both lips touch.

### 3.2 The /dʒ/ Sound ("j" as in "job")

This sound does not exist in Spanish. Speakers substitute /j/ (Spanish "y") or /ʝ/.

| Word | Incorrect | Correct |
|---|---|---|
| just | "yust" | /dʒʌst/ |
| job | "yob" | /dʒɒb/ |
| juice | "yuice" | /dʒuːs/ |
| general | "yeneral" | /ˈdʒenərəl/ |

### 3.3 The /θ/ and /ð/ Sounds ("th")

Only Castilian Spanish has /θ/ (the "c/z" sound). Latin American Spanish lacks both "th" sounds entirely.

| Sound | Word | Common Substitution | IPA |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voiceless /θ/ | think, bath | "tink" /t/ or "sink" /s/ | /θɪŋk/ |
| Voiced /ð/ | this, that | "dis" /d/ or "zis" /z/ | /ðɪs/ |

**Tip**: Place tongue between teeth. For /θ/, blow air without voicing. For /ð/, add voice.

### 3.4 Epenthetic Vowel Before Initial "s" + Consonant

Spanish does not permit /s/ + consonant at the start of a word (cf. *escuela*, *España*, *especial*). Learners insert /e/ before English clusters.

| Incorrect | Correct |
|---|---|
| espeak | speak |
| estudy | study |
| eschool | school |
| esnow | snow |
| estart | start |

### 3.5 The "-ed" Past Tense Endings

Three pronunciations depending on the final consonant:

| Rule | Sound | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| After /t/ or /d/ | /ɪd/ (extra syllable) | wanted, needed, started |
| After voiceless consonants | /t/ | walked, stopped, watched |
| After voiced consonants/vowels | /d/ | played, opened, called |

Spanish speakers tend to always pronounce a full /ed/ syllable: "walk-ED," "play-ED." Only the /ɪd/ group gets the extra syllable.

### 3.6 Silent "h"

The letter "h" is always silent in Spanish. English "h" is pronounced (aspirated) in most positions.

| Incorrect | Correct |
|---|---|
| 'ouse (silent h) | house /haʊs/ |
| 'appy | happy /ˈhæpi/ |
| 'ospital | hospital /ˈhɒspɪtəl/ |

Exception: Some English words do have silent "h" -- hour, honest, heir, honour.

### 3.7 Short vs Long Vowel Pairs

Spanish has only 5 pure vowels. English has roughly 12-15, including critical short/long distinctions.

| Short | Long | Minimal Pair |
|---|---|---|
| /ɪ/ | /iː/ | ship / sheep |
| /ʊ/ | /uː/ | full / fool |
| /e/ | /eɪ/ | bed / bade |
| /æ/ | /ɑː/ | cat / cart |
| /ɒ/ | /ɔː/ | cot / caught (in non-merged dialects) |

### 3.8 The Schwa /ə/

The most common vowel in English does not exist in Spanish. It appears in unstressed syllables.

| Word | Schwa Location | IPA |
|---|---|---|
| about | **a**bout | /ə'baʊt/ |
| banana | b**a**n**a**n**a** | /bəˈnɑːnə/ |
| problem | probl**e**m | /ˈprɒbləm/ |
| sofa | sof**a** | /ˈsəʊfə/ |

Spanish speakers give full vowel quality to every syllable, making their English sound "syllable-timed" instead of "stress-timed."

### 3.9 /z/ vs /s/ (Voiced vs Voiceless)

Spanish "s" is always voiceless. English uses both /s/ and /z/, and the letter "s" often represents /z/.

| Word | Spanish Tendency | Correct |
|---|---|---|
| dogs | /dɒɡs/ | /dɒɡz/ |
| is | /ɪs/ | /ɪz/ |
| music | /ˈmjuːsɪk/ | /ˈmjuːzɪk/ |
| reason | /ˈriːson/ | /ˈriːzən/ |
| please | /pliːs/ | /pliːz/ |

### 3.10 Word Stress Patterns

Spanish stress is largely predictable (penultimate syllable by default, accent marks otherwise). English stress is irregular and must be learned per word.

| Word | Spanish Tendency | Correct English Stress |
|---|---|---|
| comfortable | com-for-TA-ble | COM-fort-able |
| interesting | in-te-RES-ting | IN-ter-est-ing |
| hotel | HO-tel | ho-TEL |
| development | de-ve-LOP-ment | de-VEL-op-ment |
| photograph | fo-to-GRAPH | PHO-to-graph |

### 3.11 The "r" Sound

Spanish has a trilled /r/ and tapped /ɾ/. English uses an approximant /ɹ/.

Producing the English "r": tongue does NOT touch the roof of the mouth. Curl it slightly back without contact.

### 3.12 Vowel Reduction in Unstressed Syllables

Related to the schwa issue. Spanish maintains vowel quality in all syllables. In English, unstressed vowels collapse to /ə/ or /ɪ/.

| Word | Spanish-Style | English-Style |
|---|---|---|
| chocolate | CHO-CO-LA-TE | CHOC-lit /ˈtʃɒklɪt/ |
| vegetable | VE-GE-TA-BLE | VEJ-tə-bəl /ˈvedʒtəbəl/ |
| comfortable | COM-FOR-TA-BLE | COMF-tər-bəl /ˈkʌmftəbəl/ |

### 3.13 Final Consonant Clusters

Spanish syllable structure is simpler. English permits complex final clusters that Spanish speakers may simplify.

| Cluster | Example | Simplified to |
|---|---|---|
| /sts/ | tests | "tes" |
| /sks/ | desks | "des" |
| /lps/ | helps | "hels" |
| /ndz/ | hands | "hans" |

## 4. Cultural Communication Differences

### 4.1 Tu / Usted Mapping to English

| Spanish Register | English Equivalent | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Tu | You (informal) | Friends, peers, same-age colleagues |
| Usted | You (formal) | Also just "you" -- English has no formal "you" |
| Ustedes | You (plural) | "You all," "you guys," "everyone" |

English relies on tone, word choice, and titles (Mr., Dr., Professor) rather than pronoun changes to signal formality. A common Spanish-speaker mistake is being either too formal (overly stiff) or too informal (not understanding that formality is expressed differently).

### 4.2 Directness Levels

Spanish communication (especially in Spain) can be quite direct. American English often uses hedging and softeners.

| Spanish Direct Style | American English Softened Style |
|---|---|
| Give me the report | Could you send me the report when you get a chance? |
| That's wrong | I think there might be an issue with that |
| I don't agree | I see your point, but I have a different perspective |
| I need this by Friday | It would be great if we could have this by Friday |

British English tends to be even more indirect than American English.

### 4.3 Small Talk Conventions

| Topic | Spanish Culture | English (US/UK) Culture |
|---|---|---|
| Health | "How are you?" expects a real answer | "How are you?" = "Hello" (answer: "Fine, thanks") |
| Family | Common first-meeting topic | Generally reserved for closer relationships |
| Money/salary | Sometimes discussed openly | Considered very private |
| Weather | Less common filler | Default small-talk topic (especially UK) |
| Age | Often asked casually | Can be rude to ask directly |

### 4.4 Business Email Tone

| Spanish Email Habit | English Business Norm |
|---|---|
| "Estimado Sr. Garcia" (Dear Mr. Garcia) | "Hi John" / "Dear John" (first name common) |
| Long formal greeting paragraph | Get to the point quickly |
| "Le saluda atentamente" (formal close) | "Best," / "Thanks," / "Regards," |
| Multiple exclamation marks for enthusiasm | One or none -- multiple looks unprofessional |

### 4.5 Humor Differences

- **Spanish humor**: Often self-deprecating, ironic, direct teasing among friends. Regional jokes are common.
- **English (US) humor**: Ranges from sarcasm to observational. Sarcasm is extremely common but can confuse learners.
- **English (UK) humor**: Very dry, deadpan, and ironic. What sounds like a compliment may be an insult and vice versa.
- **Key pitfall**: Translating jokes literally almost never works. Humor is deeply cultural.

### 4.6 Time and Punctuality

| Context | Spanish Norm (varies by country) | US/UK Norm |
|---|---|---|
| Business meeting | 5-15 min flexibility (Spain/LatAm varies) | On time or 1-2 min early |
| Dinner party | 15-30 min late is normal | Within 5-10 min of stated time |
| "I'll be there in 5 minutes" | Could mean 15-20 min | Usually means 5-10 min |

### 4.7 Greetings and Physical Contact

| Context | Spanish Culture | US Culture | UK Culture |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meeting someone new | One or two kisses on cheek | Handshake | Handshake |
| Greeting a friend | Kiss on cheek, hug | Hug, wave, or verbal | Verbal, sometimes hug |
| Business meeting | Handshake + possible cheek kiss | Firm handshake | Firm handshake |
| Personal space | Closer proximity | Arm's length | Arm's length or more |
