## 1. False Cognates (Falsos Amigos)

These are the words that betray you. They look like Portuguese words but mean something completely different in English. Renata will reach for these instinctively — the agent should catch them before they cause confusion.

| # | Portuguese Word | Looks Like (EN) | Actually Means (EN) | Correct English Equivalent | Example (Correct Usage) |
|---|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **atualmente** | actually | currently, nowadays | currently / nowadays | "She **currently** works at Google." (NOT "She actually works at Google" — that implies surprise.) |
| 2 | **pretender** | pretend | to intend, to plan | to intend / to plan | "I **intend** to apply for that job." (NOT "I pretend to apply.") |
| 3 | **livraria** | library | bookstore | bookstore | "I bought this at the **bookstore**." (A **library** is a biblioteca.) |
| 4 | **fabrica** | fabric | factory | factory | "My uncle owns a **factory** in Sao Paulo." (**Fabric** means tecido.) |
| 5 | **puxar** | push | to pull | to pull | "**Pull** the door to open it." (**Push** means empurrar — the opposite.) |
| 6 | **sensivel** | sensible | sensitive | sensitive | "She's very **sensitive** about criticism." (**Sensible** means sensato/prudente.) |
| 7 | **eventualmente** | eventually | occasionally, sometimes | occasionally | "I **occasionally** eat sushi." (**Eventually** means no final das contas.) |
| 8 | **particular** | particular | private, personal | private | "This is a **private** matter." (In English, **particular** means especifico.) |
| 9 | **novela** | novel | soap opera / TV series | soap opera | "She watches a **soap opera** every night." (A **novel** is a romance/livro.) |
| 10 | **colegio** | college | high school / secondary school | high school | "I graduated from **high school** in 2010." (**College** means faculdade.) |
| 11 | **atender** | attend | to answer (phone/door) | to answer | "Can you **answer** the phone?" (**Attend** means comparecer/participar.) |
| 12 | **resumo** | resume | summary, abstract | summary | "Here's a **summary** of the report." (A **resume** is a curriculo.) |
| 13 | **parentes** | parents | relatives, extended family | relatives | "All my **relatives** came to the wedding." (**Parents** means pais — mae e pai.) |
| 14 | **costume** | costume | habit, custom | habit / custom | "It's a Brazilian **custom** to eat rice and beans daily." (A **costume** is a fantasia.) |
| 15 | **contestar** | contest | to dispute, to challenge | to dispute | "The lawyer will **dispute** the charge." (To **contest** is closer, but carries a competitive/formal tone in English.) |
| 16 | **compromisso** | compromise | commitment, appointment | commitment / appointment | "I have an **appointment** at 3 PM." (A **compromise** means acordo mutuo.) |
| 17 | **exquisito** | exquisite | weird, strange | weird / strange | "That food tasted **strange**." (**Exquisite** means requintado — a compliment.) |
| 18 | **sympathico** | sympathetic | nice, likeable, friendly | nice / friendly | "Your boss is really **friendly**." (**Sympathetic** means compreensivo/solidario.) |
| 19 | **noticia** | notice | news | news | "Did you hear the **news** about the election?" (A **notice** is an aviso.) |
| 20 | **realizar** | realize | to carry out, to accomplish | to carry out / to accomplish | "We need to **carry out** this project by Friday." (To **realize** means perceber/dar-se conta.) |
| 21 | **assistir** | assist | to watch, to attend | to watch | "I **watched** the game last night." (To **assist** means ajudar.) |
| 22 | **educado** | educated | polite, well-mannered | polite | "He is very **polite**." (**Educated** means instruido, with formal education.) |
| 23 | **pasta** | pasta | folder, briefcase | folder / briefcase | "Put the documents in the **folder**." (**Pasta** in English is only the food — macarrao.) |
| 24 | **propaganda** | propaganda | advertisement, commercial | advertisement / ad | "I saw an **ad** for that product on TV." (**Propaganda** implies political manipulation in English.) |
| 25 | **aposentado** | — (no lookalike) | retired | retired | Included because Brazilians sometimes say "he is aposentated" — the correct word is simply **retired**. |

### How to use this table as an agent

When Renata uses any word from the "Looks Like" column in a way that matches the Portuguese meaning, gently offer the correct English word. Frame it as: *"Just a heads-up — in English, [word] actually means [X]. The word you're looking for is [Y]."*

## 2. Grammar Patterns That Transfer Wrong

These are structural habits from Portuguese that produce grammatically incorrect or unnatural English. They are deeply ingrained and will recur — correct patiently and consistently.

### 2.1 Ser/Estar Collapse into "To Be"

Portuguese has two verbs for "to be." English has one, but the distinction still matters in how you phrase things.

| Portuguese | English Trap | Correct English | Note |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|------|
| Eu **sou** engenheira. | I am an engineer. | I **am** an engineer. | Permanent state — works fine. |
| Eu **estou** cansada. | I am tired. | I **am** tired. | Temporary state — also fine, but Renata may overthink this. |
| Ela **esta** bonita hoje. | She is beautiful today. | She **looks** beautiful today. | "Estar bonita" implies temporary — English uses "looks" for this nuance. |
| Ele **e** chato. | He is boring. | He **is** boring. | "Ser chato" = personality. This maps directly. |
| Ele **esta** chato. | He is being annoying. | He **is being** annoying (right now). | "Estar chato" = temporary behavior. English uses "is being." |

### 2.2 Article Overuse and Absence

Portuguese uses definite articles far more broadly than English. This creates two opposite errors.

**Overuse (adding "the" where English omits it):**
- "**The** life is beautiful." -> "Life is beautiful." (General/abstract nouns take no article.)
- "**The** Brazil is a big country." -> "Brazil is a big country." (Most country names take no article.)
- "**The** love is important." -> "Love is important."
- "I like **the** chocolate." -> "I like chocolate." (General preference = no article.)

**Absence (dropping "the" where English requires it):**
- "I went to Ø hospital." -> "I went to **the** hospital." (American English; British English drops it.)
- "She plays Ø piano." -> "She plays **the** piano." (Musical instruments take "the.")

**The underlying rule:** Portuguese says "Eu gosto **do** futebol" (I like **the** soccer), but English says "I like soccer." When talking about things in general, English drops the article.

### 2.3 Preposition Differences

Portuguese prepositions do not map 1:1 to English prepositions. These are the most common traps.

| Portuguese | Wrong English | Correct English |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| depender **de** | depend **of** | depend **on** |
| casado **com** | married **with** | married **to** |
| sonhar **com** | dream **with** | dream **about/of** |
| pensar **em** | think **in** | think **about** |
| ir **para** o trabalho | go **for** work | go **to** work |
| assistir **a** um filme | assist **to** a movie | watch a movie |
| pagar **por** | pay **for** (correct!) | pay **for** (this one actually works) |
| preocupar-se **com** | worry **with** | worry **about** |
| interessar-se **por** | interest **for** | interested **in** |
| consistir **em** | consist **in** | consist **of** |

### 2.4 Do-Support (Negation and Questions)

Portuguese negates verbs directly: "Eu **nao** gosto." English requires an auxiliary "do": "I **don't** like it."

| Error | Correction | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| "I **no** like coffee." | "I **don't** like coffee." | English requires do + not for negation of most verbs. |
| "She **no** went to the party." | "She **didn't** go to the party." | Past tense negation uses "didn't" + base verb. |
| "I **no** can do this." | "I **can't** do this." | Modal verbs negate directly — no do-support needed. |

### 2.5 Question Formation

Portuguese often forms questions by intonation alone (SVO order stays the same). English inverts subject and auxiliary verb.

| Error | Correction |
|-------|-----------|
| "You are happy?" | "**Are you** happy?" |
| "She likes pizza?" | "**Does she** like pizza?" |
| "He went to the store?" | "**Did he** go to the store?" |
| "You can help me?" | "**Can you** help me?" |

Note: In casual spoken English, rising intonation questions ("You're coming?") are acceptable. But in professional/written contexts, proper inversion is expected.

### 2.6 Present Perfect vs. Simple Past

Portuguese does not make the same distinction. "Eu ja comi" can mean both "I already ate" and "I have already eaten." Renata will default to simple past where present perfect is more natural.

| Situation | Correct English | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Experience (ever in your life) | "I **have been** to Paris." | Not "I went to Paris" (unless specifying when). |
| Unfinished time period | "I **have had** three meetings **today**." | Today isn't over — use present perfect. |
| Recent action with present relevance | "I **have just finished** the report." | The report is done now — the present matters. |
| Specific past time | "I **went** to Paris **in 2019**." | Specific time = simple past. |

### 2.7 Continuous/Progressive Overuse

Portuguese uses the present continuous ("estou fazendo") more broadly. In English, some verbs (stative verbs) rarely take the continuous form.

| Error | Correction | Rule |
|-------|-----------|------|
| "I **am loving** this restaurant." | "I **love** this restaurant." | "Love" is a stative verb — no continuous. |
| "I **am knowing** the answer." | "I **know** the answer." | "Know" is stative. |
| "She **is having** a car." | "She **has** a car." | "Have" (possession) is stative. |
| "I **am understanding** now." | "I **understand** now." | "Understand" is stative. |
| "I **am needing** help." | "I **need** help." | "Need" is stative. |

### 2.8 Adjective Order

Portuguese places adjectives after the noun. English places them before. When multiple adjectives are used, English has a strict (unwritten) order: opinion - size - age - shape - color - origin - material - purpose.

| Error | Correction |
|-------|-----------|
| "a car **red**" | "a **red** car" |
| "a house **big and beautiful**" | "a **beautiful big** house" |
| "a table **wooden round**" | "a **round wooden** table" |

### 2.9 Double Negatives

Portuguese uses double (and triple) negatives freely: "Eu nao tenho nada" (literally: "I don't have nothing"). In standard English, this is an error — two negatives make a positive.

| Error | Correction |
|-------|-----------|
| "I don't have **nothing**." | "I don't have **anything**." / "I have **nothing**." |
| "She didn't tell **nobody**." | "She didn't tell **anybody**." / "She told **nobody**." |
| "I can't find it **nowhere**." | "I can't find it **anywhere**." / "I can find it **nowhere**." |

### 2.10 Make vs. Do

Portuguese uses "fazer" for both. English distinguishes them, and the rules are mostly arbitrary.

| Use **DO** for | Use **MAKE** for |
|---------------|-----------------|
| do homework | make a mistake |
| do the dishes | make a decision |
| do a favor | make money |
| do business | make an effort |
| do your best | make a plan |
| do exercise | make progress |
| do research | make a suggestion |
| do damage | make an appointment |
| do well/badly | make a phone call |

**General pattern (imperfect but helpful):** "Do" relates to tasks/activities/work. "Make" relates to creating/producing something.

### 2.11 There is/are vs. Have/Has

Portuguese uses "ter" (to have) for existence: "Tem um banco aqui perto?" English uses "there is/there are."

| Error | Correction |
|-------|-----------|
| "**Has** a bank near here?" | "**Is there** a bank near here?" |
| "**Have** many people at the party." | "**There are** many people at the party." |
| "**Has** a problem with the system." | "**There is** a problem with the system." |

## 3. Pronunciation Traps

These are sounds, stress patterns, and phonetic habits that Portuguese speakers consistently struggle with. The agent should be aware of these when interpreting voice input or advising on spoken English.

### 3.1 The "th" Sounds

English has two "th" sounds that do not exist in Portuguese. Brazilians substitute them with the closest Portuguese sounds.

| English Sound | IPA | Substitution | Example Words |
|--------------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| voiceless "th" | /θ/ | /t/, /f/, or /s/ | **think**, **three**, **math**, **anything** |
| voiced "th" | /ð/ | /d/ or /z/ | **the**, **this**, **that**, **mother**, **weather** |

Common result: "think" sounds like "tink" or "fink." "The" sounds like "de." "Mother" sounds like "mudder."

**Coaching tip:** Place tongue between teeth. For /θ/, blow air without voicing. For /ð/, add voice.

### 3.2 Past Tense "-ed" Endings

The "-ed" suffix has three pronunciations. Portuguese speakers often add an extra syllable to all of them.

| Rule | Pronunciation | Examples | Common Error |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| After /t/ or /d/ | /ɪd/ (extra syllable) | want**ed**, need**ed** | (This one is correct with the extra syllable.) |
| After voiceless sounds | /t/ (no extra syllable) | walk**ed** = "walkt", stopp**ed** = "stopt" | Saying "walk-**ed**" with two syllables. |
| After voiced sounds | /d/ (no extra syllable) | play**ed** = "playd", call**ed** = "calld" | Saying "play-**ed**" with two syllables. |

### 3.3 Consonant Clusters at Word Endings

Portuguese syllable structure is generally CV (consonant-vowel). English allows complex final consonant clusters. Brazilians often insert a vowel to break up the cluster.

| Word | Common BR Pronunciation | Correct | Inserted Sound |
|------|------------------------|---------|---------------|
| world | "world-ee" or "world-jee" | /wɜːrld/ | Extra vowel at end |
| months | "month-ees" | /mʌnθs/ | Extra vowel |
| text | "tech-ee" | /tekst/ | Extra vowel |
| asked | "ask-ed" | /æskt/ | Extra syllable |
| desks | "desk-ees" | /desks/ | Extra vowel |
| film | "fill-mee" | /fɪlm/ | Extra vowel |

### 3.4 Short vs. Long Vowels

Portuguese does not have a meaningful short/long vowel distinction. English does, and getting it wrong changes the word.

| Short Vowel | Long Vowel | Minimal Pair |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| /ɪ/ (bit) | /iː/ (beat) | ship / sheep |
| /ʊ/ (full) | /uː/ (fool) | pull / pool |
| /æ/ (bat) | /ɑː/ (bar) | cat / cart |
| /ɛ/ (bed) | /eɪ/ (bade) | set / sate |
| /ʌ/ (cut) | /ɑː/ (cart) | hut / heart |

### 3.5 The English "r"

The English approximant /ɹ/ does not exist in Portuguese. Depending on dialect, Brazilian Portuguese "r" may be /h/ (carioca), /ʁ/ (uvular), or a tap /ɾ/. This causes significant differences.

| Position | Issue | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Word-initial | "r" pronounced as /h/ | "red" sounds like "hed" |
| Between vowels | May tap instead of approximate | "very" sounds like "veddy" |
| After consonant | May drop or guttural | "three" sounds like "thee" or "free" |
| Word-final | May be dropped or aspirated | "car" sounds like "cah" |

### 3.6 Silent Letters

English is full of silent letters that Portuguese speakers will pronounce.

| Word | Silent Letter(s) | Common Error |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| knight | k, gh | "kuh-night" |
| psychology | p | "puh-sychology" |
| Wednesday | first d | "Wed-nes-day" |
| salmon | l | "sal-mon" |
| receipt | p | "re-ceipt" |
| debt | b | "debt" (with b sound) |
| island | s | "is-land" |
| subtle | b | "sub-tle" |

### 3.7 Word Stress

Portuguese stress is fairly predictable (usually penultimate syllable, marked with accents when not). English stress is irregular and often changes word meaning or part of speech.

| Word | Correct Stress | Common BR Error | Note |
|------|---------------|----------------|------|
| develop | de-**VEL**-op | **DEV**-elop | Stress on second syllable |
| comfortable | **COM**-fort-able | com-**FOR**-table | Stress on first syllable |
| interesting | **IN**-ter-est-ing | in-ter-**EST**-ing | Stress on first syllable |
| hotel | ho-**TEL** | **HO**-tel | Stress on second syllable |
| record (noun) | **REC**-ord | re-**CORD** | Noun vs. verb stress shift |
| record (verb) | re-**CORD** | **REC**-ord | Noun vs. verb stress shift |

### 3.8 The Schwa /ə/

The most common vowel sound in English, and the one Portuguese speakers most consistently replace with a full vowel. English reduces unstressed vowels to /ə/; Portuguese does not.

| Word | Schwa Location | Common BR Error |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **a**bout | first syllable | Full "ah" instead of /ə/ |
| prob**a**bly | second syllable | Full "ah" |
| syst**e**m | second syllable | Full "eh" |
| mem**o**ry | second syllable | Full "oh" |
| pres**i**dent | second syllable | Full "ee" |

### 3.9 "H" Dropping and Hypercorrection

Portuguese "h" is always silent. This leads to two opposite errors in English.

| Error Type | Example | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| H-dropping | "I'm **'**appy" (happy) | Dropping the English "h" because it's silent in Portuguese |
| Hypercorrection | "I went to **H**Italy" | Adding "h" where it doesn't belong, overcompensating |

### 3.10 "W" vs. "V" Confusion

Some Brazilian dialects (especially from the south) interchange /w/ and /v/.

- "wine" may sound like "vine"
- "vet" may sound like "wet"
- "very well" may become "wery vell"

### 3.11 Final "-ing" as "-een" or "-eeng"

Brazilians often pronounce the final "-ing" with a hard /g/ or as a nasal "-een."

- "running" becomes "runneen" or "running-guh"
- "going" becomes "goeen"
- Correct: the "ng" is a single nasal sound /ŋ/, not /n/ + /g/

## 4. Cultural Communication Differences

Understanding how communication norms differ between Brazilian and English-speaking (especially American) professional contexts. The agent should help Renata navigate these when drafting emails, preparing for calls, or reflecting on interactions.

### 4.1 Directness in Professional Settings

| Brazilian Norm | American/English Norm | Advice for Renata |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Build relationship before business ("primeiro o cafezinho") | Get to business quickly, then socialize | In emails and calls, state your purpose in the first 1-2 sentences. Relationship-building happens, but it's briefer. |
| Use indirect phrasing to soften requests | More direct requests are expected and not considered rude | "Could you send me the report by Friday?" is perfectly polite. No need for elaborate lead-in. |
| Hierarchy is respected verbally (senhor/senhora, doutor) | First names are used quickly, even with senior people | If someone says "Call me Mike," do it. Using titles after this feels stiff. |

### 4.2 Small Talk Topics

| Safe Topics | Risky/Avoid Topics |
|------------|-------------------|
| Weather, weekend plans | Salary, income, cost of things you own |
| Sports, entertainment | Age (especially for women) |
| Travel, vacations | Weight, physical appearance (even compliments can misfire) |
| Food, restaurants | Religion, politics (with people you don't know well) |
| Pets | Immigration status |
| Local events | Relationship status (if not volunteered) |

Note: Brazilians often ask about family early — this is fine in English too, but keep it light ("Do you have kids?" is okay; "Why don't you have kids?" is not).

### 4.3 Email Tone

| Brazilian Business Email | English Business Email |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Long, formal greetings ("Prezado Senhor, espero que esta mensagem o encontre bem...") | Short greeting ("Hi Sarah," or "Hello,") |
| Elaborate closings with well-wishes | "Best," / "Thanks," / "Regards," |
| Formal throughout, even with regular contacts | Quickly becomes informal after first exchange |
| Longer paragraphs, more context | Short paragraphs, bullet points preferred |

**Template for Renata:**
```
Hi [Name],

[One sentence: purpose of email.]

[2-3 sentences: details or context.]

[One sentence: clear ask or next step.]

Best,
Renata
```

### 4.4 "How Are You?" — The Non-Question

In American English, "How are you?" is a greeting, not a genuine inquiry. The expected response is "Good, thanks! You?" or "I'm well, how about you?" — not an actual status report.

- **Do not** respond with a detailed account of how you're actually feeling (unless with close friends).
- **Do not** skip the return question — always say "And you?" or "How about you?"
- If someone asks "What's up?" the answer is "Not much" or "Hey!" — not a literal list of what is up.

### 4.5 Saying "No" and Hedging

English (especially American English) softens rejection. Brazilians do this too, but with different phrases.

| Direct (too blunt) | Softened (natural English) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| "No." | "I'm afraid I can't." |
| "That's wrong." | "I see it a bit differently." |
| "I don't want to." | "I'd rather not, if that's okay." |
| "That won't work." | "That might be tricky — could we try [X] instead?" |
| "I disagree." | "I see your point, but I was thinking..." |

### 4.6 Humor

Brazilian humor is warm, physical, and inclusive. English humor (especially British) tends toward sarcasm, dry wit, and understatement. American humor is more varied but often self-deprecating.

- If someone says something sarcastic ("Oh great, another Monday"), they don't mean it literally.
- Self-deprecating humor ("I'm terrible at this") is not a cry for help. Responding with "No, you're great!" is fine, but matching with your own self-deprecation also works.
- Avoid humor about appearance, religion, or politics until you know someone well.

### 4.7 Physical Greetings

| Brazilian Norm | English-Speaking Norm |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Kiss on cheek(s) for greetings | Handshake in professional settings; sometimes a brief hug with friends |
| Frequent touch during conversation | More personal space; touch is reserved for close friends |
| Standing close | Arm's length distance in conversation |
| Hugs are standard even in semi-professional settings | Hugs in professional settings can be awkward — read the room |

### 4.8 Time Perception

| Brazilian Norm | American/English Norm |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 15-30 minutes late is normal socially | 5 minutes late is the maximum for social events |
| "Vou chegar ja ja" is vague | Give a specific ETA ("I'll be there in 10 minutes") |
| Meetings can drift in timing | Meetings start on time; ending late is common but starting late is not |
| Deadlines have flexibility | Deadlines are hard. "By Friday" means by Friday. |

## 5. Common Sentence Structure Errors

These are the errors Renata is most likely to produce in everyday communication. The agent should recognize these patterns and offer corrections with brief explanations.

| # | Wrong | Right | Why |
|---|-------|-------|-----|
| 1 | "I **have** 25 years." | "I **am** 25 years old." | Portuguese uses "ter" (to have) for age. English uses "to be." |
| 2 | "I **am agree** with you." | "I **agree** with you." | "Agree" is already a verb. No "am" needed. |
| 3 | "She has **a** beautiful **hair**." | "She has beautiful **hair**." | "Hair" (in general) is uncountable in English. No article. |
| 4 | "He told me **for** go there." | "He told me **to** go there." | Portuguese "para" becomes "to" before infinitives, not "for." |
| 5 | "I **stay** in home on weekends." | "I **stay** at home on weekends." / "I **stay home** on weekends." | "Ficar" = to stay. But also: "at home," not "in home." |
| 6 | "She is **more older** than me." | "She is **older** than me." | Comparative: either "more + adjective" or "adjective-er," never both. |
| 7 | "I **use to** go there every day." | "I **used to** go there every day." | Past habit requires "used to" (with -d). |
| 8 | "He **don't** like pizza." | "He **doesn't** like pizza." | Third person singular requires "doesn't." |
| 9 | "I need **that** you help me." | "I need you **to** help me." | Portuguese "preciso que voce me ajude" uses a subjunctive clause. English uses infinitive. |
| 10 | "**The** people in Brazil are friendly." | "**People** in Brazil are friendly." | General statement = no article. (But "The people **I met** in Brazil" = specific, so article is needed.) |
| 11 | "I want **go** to the store." | "I want **to go** to the store." | "Want" requires "to" + infinitive. |
| 12 | "**Is** raining." | "**It's** raining." | English requires a subject. Portuguese drops it ("Esta chovendo"). |
| 13 | "She **can** to swim." | "She **can** swim." | Modal verbs (can, must, should, will) take bare infinitive — no "to." |
| 14 | "I **am** here **since** 2020." | "I **have been** here **since** 2020." | "Since" + point in time = present perfect (not simple present). |
| 15 | "He **suggested me** to go." | "He **suggested that I** go." / "He **suggested I** go." | "Suggest" uses a that-clause or bare subjunctive, not object + infinitive. |
| 16 | "I **enjoy** of music." | "I **enjoy** music." | "Enjoy" is transitive — no preposition needed. ("Gostar de" requires "de," but English "enjoy" does not.) |
| 17 | "**Depend of** the situation." | "It **depends on** the situation." | "Depend on," not "depend of." Also requires a subject ("it"). |
| 18 | "I will **cut** my hair tomorrow." | "I will **get** my hair **cut** tomorrow." / "I'm **getting** a haircut tomorrow." | Unless Renata is cutting her own hair, use causative "get + object + past participle." |
| 19 | "**Have** a lot of people here." | "**There are** a lot of people here." | Existence uses "there is/are" in English, not "have." |
| 20 | "I **said** her to come." | "I **told** her to come." | "Say" doesn't take an indirect object directly. "Tell" does: tell + person + to do. |
| 21 | "She is **doctor**." | "She is **a** doctor." | English requires an article before professions. Portuguese often drops it ("Ela e medica"). |
| 22 | "I **made** a course online." | "I **took** a course online." | Portuguese "fazer um curso" = "take a course" in English. "Make a course" means to create one. |
| 23 | "He **arrived** in the office **at** 9." | "He **arrived at** the office **at** 9." | "Arrive at" for specific places. "Arrive in" for cities/countries. |
| 24 | "I **explained** her the problem." | "I **explained** the problem **to** her." | "Explain" requires "to" before the indirect object. |
| 25 | "My english **is** very **good**?" | "**Is** my English very good?" | Questions require inversion — don't just add rising intonation to a statement. |

## Agent Behavior Notes

When correcting Renata:
1. **Be warm but clear.** Frame corrections as tips, not failures. Example: "Quick note — in English we say 'I am 25' instead of 'I have 25 years.' Portuguese uses 'ter' for age, but English uses 'to be.' Totally natural mistake."
2. **Don't correct everything at once.** If a message has 4 errors, fix the 1-2 most important ones. Address others in future interactions.
3. **Pattern-match, don't just spell-check.** If Renata writes "depend of," don't just fix it — note that prepositions are a common transfer issue and offer 2-3 related examples.
4. **Celebrate progress.** If she correctly uses a pattern she previously got wrong, acknowledge it.
5. **Use Portuguese strategically.** When explaining a tricky concept, a brief Portuguese comparison ("In Portuguese you'd say X, but in English it works like Y") makes the explanation click faster.
