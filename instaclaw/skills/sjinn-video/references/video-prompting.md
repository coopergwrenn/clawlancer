# Video Prompt Enhancement Guide

## Enhancement Philosophy

When enhancing user prompts for video generation, follow these 5 rules:

1. **Preserve the user's core intent** — Don't change WHAT they want, enhance HOW it looks
2. **Add cinematic language** — Camera movements, lighting, atmosphere, mood
3. **Add sensory details** — Textures, sounds, weather, time of day, materials
4. **Specify technical parameters** — Aspect ratio, duration, quality mode
5. **Keep it concise** — Sjinn works best with focused prompts, not novels (2-4 sentences ideal)
