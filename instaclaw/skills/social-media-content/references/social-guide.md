## Platform Character Limits

| Platform | Post Limit | Bio Limit |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Twitter/X | 280 chars (or 25K for threads) | 160 chars |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 chars (posts), 120K (articles) | 2,600 chars |
| Reddit | 40,000 chars | N/A |
| Instagram | 2,200 chars | 150 chars |
| TikTok | 2,200 chars (caption) | 80 chars |

## Hashtag Guidelines

| Platform | Count | Style |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Twitter | 1-3 | Niche, integrated into text |
| LinkedIn | 3-5 | Professional, at bottom |
| Instagram | 20-30 | Niche-specific, in comment or after dots |
| Reddit | 0 | Hashtags don't work on Reddit |
| TikTok | 3-5 | Trending + niche mix |

**Rule:** Research actual hashtags your community uses. Generic tags like `#AI #Innovation #FutureOfWork` hurt more than help.
